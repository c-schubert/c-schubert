### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ and welcome to my github page

I'm Christian a process engineer currently working at SMS Group. 
I studied materials engineering at the RWTH Aachen University and have done my PhD at the department for industrial furnaces and heat engineering of the RWTH.
My work is mainly focused on the process engineering and R&D of heat treatment within the steel but also non-ferrous industry.
I would describe myself mostly as an process engieer and applied user of CFD and FEM modelling software. 
Within this field I am more focused on the modelling target (application) than on the development the foundational numerical methods itself.
Within my repositories you will mostly find "user defined" extensions of CFD codes (ANSYS Fluent and OpenFOAM), as well as some self-written heat engineering process simulation libraries/software.
All repositories are not very well maintained, as they were mostly generated within the context of specific projects. 
You can find more about my research projects on my researchgate or orchid page.
